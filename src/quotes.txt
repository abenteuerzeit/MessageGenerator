8|Federico Fellini|Italian director|I don’t believe in total freedom for the artist. Left on his own, free to do anything he likes, the artist ends up doing nothing at all.

209|Ray Bradbury|American writer|Ask for no guarantees ask for no security there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth, which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life away.
210|André Gide|French writer|One does not discover new lands<br>without consenting to lose sight of<br>the shore for a very long time.
211|Vincent van Gogh|Dutch painter|Just dash something down if you see a blank canvas staring at you with a certain imbecility. You do not know how paralyzing it is, that staring of a blank canvas, which says to the painter: you don’t know anything.
212|David Mamet|American playwright|In a world we find terrifying, we ratify<br>that which doesn’t threaten us.
213|Mike Myers|Canadian actor|I still believe that at any time the no-<br>talent police will come and arrest me.
214|Georgia O’Keeffe|American painter|I always have a curious sort of feeling about some of my things—I hate to show them—I am perfectly inconsistent about it—I am afraid people won’t understand—and I hope they won’t—and am afraid they will.
215|John Steinbeck|American writer|We spend our time searching for<br>security and hate it when we get it.
216|Tennessee Williams|American playwright|Oh, you weak, beautiful people who give<br>up with such grace. What you need is<br>someone to take hold of you—gently, with<br>love, and hand your life back to you.
217|Pierre Alechinsky|Belgian artist|When I paint, I liberate monsters … They are the manifestations of all the doubts, searches, and groping for meaning and expression which all artists experience … One does not choose the content one submits to it.
218|Michelangelo|Italian artist|I am no artist—please come and help me.
219|Claude Monet|French painter|I still don’t know where I am<br>going to sleep tomorrow.
220|Diane Arenberg|American artist|Being true to yourself is what feeds<br>creativity, not self-doubt and criticism.
221|William Blake|English poet|If the Sun and Moon should ever<br>doubt, they’d immediately go out.
222|Thomas Carlyle|Scottish writer|Doubt, of whatever kind, can be ended<br>by action alone.
223|Kahlil Gibran|Lebanese-American writer and artist|Doubt is a pain too lonely to know<br>that faith is his twin brother.
224|Christian Nestell Bovee|American author|Doubt whom you will<br>but never yourself.
225|Edgar Degas|French artist|I felt so insufficiently equipped, so unprepared, so weak, and at the same time it seemed to me that my reflections on art were correct. I quarreled with all the world and with myself.
226|Paul Gauguin|French artist|What still concerns me the most is: am I<br>on the right track am I making progress<br>am I making mistakes in art?
227|Ernst Haas|Austrian artist|Every work of art has its necessity find out your very own. Ask yourself if you would do it if nobody would ever see it, if you would never be compensated for it, if nobody ever wanted it. If you come to a clear “yes” in spite of it, then go ahead and don’t doubt it anymore.
228|Marc Chagall|Russian-French artist|But perhaps my art is the art of a lunatic,<br>I thought, mere glittering quicksilver, a<br>blue soul breaking in upon my pictures.
229|Robert Hughes|Australian art critic and writer|The greater the artist, the greater the<br>doubt. Perfect confidence is given to the<br>less talented as a consolation prize.
230|Wassily Kandinsky|Russian painter|Doubts must be resolved alone within<br>the soul. Otherwise one would profane<br>one’s own powerful solution.
231|Suzanne Partridge|English painter|As long as I keep getting rejected, I know<br>I must be doing something right.
232|Dean Koontz|American author|I think it’s the people who have no doubt<br>that every word they put down is gold<br>that probably don’t write very well.
233|William Shakespeare|English writer|Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the<br>good we oft might win by fearing to attempt.
234|Leonardo da Vinci|Italian artist|That painter who has no doubts will achieve little.
235|T. S. Eliot|American-born English poet|Anxiety is the<br>handmaiden of creativity.
236|Marney Ward|Canadian artist|The analytical left brain not only breaks the painting into its components it is also the doubter, the inhibitor, and the one that doesn’t want to ruin the painting.
237|Neil Welliver|American artist|Doubt is a central factor all the time. There’s always the doubt: What the hell am I doing out here in the middle of the woods, all alone, painting?
238|John Constable|English painter|I know very well what I am about and that my skies have not been neglected, though they often failed in execution—and often no doubt from over-anxiety about them …
239|Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|American poet|Into each life some rain must fall some<br>days must be dark and dreary.
240|Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|American poet|He that respects himself is safe from others<br>he wears a coat of mail that none can pierce.
241|Claude Monet|French painter|No one but myself knows the anxiety I go<br>through and the trouble I give myself to<br>finish paintings which do not satisfy me<br>and seem to please so very few others.
242|Joyce Cary|Anglo-Irish writer and artist|What I say to an artist is, “When<br>you can’t paint—paint.”
243|Luc Tuymans|Belgian artist|When I start to paint, it is real agony. I get nervous. The day before, I am already working up to it. Then I get to the studio and, once the image starts to emerge and come together, pleasure kicks in. And then you can see things that no other person can see.
244|Theodore Roethke|American poet|Those who are willing to be vulnerable<br>move among mysteries.
245|Jane Champagne|Canadian painter|Instead of “What ever made me think I<br>was a painter?” change it to “What made<br>me a painter? Let me count the ways.”
246|William Faulkner|American writer|People need trouble—a little frustration to sharpen the spirit on, toughen it. Artists do I don’t mean you need to live in a rat hole or gutter, but you have to learn fortitude, endurance. Only vegetables are happy.
247|Scott Adams|American cartoonist|Most success springs from an obstacle or failure. I became a cartoonist largely because I failed in my goal of becoming a successful executive.
248|Coco Chanel|French fashion designer|Success is often achieved by those who<br>don’t know that failure is inevitable.
249|Edward Dowden|Irish poet|Sometimes a noble failure serves the world<br>as faithfully as a distinguished success.
250|George Eliot|English writer|Failure after long perseverance is much<br>grander than never to have a striving<br>good enough to be called a failure.
251|Ralph Waldo Emerson|American writer|The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it—so fine that we often are on the line and do not know it.
252|Vincent van Gogh|Dutch painter|I’ve failed again\!
253|Napoleon Hill|American writer|When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound, rebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal.
254|Audrey Flack|American artist|If you can’t paint, paint big.
255|Jane Fulton Alt|American photographer|Whether or not your work was included<br>in this show should not discourage you<br>from continuing your artistic pursuits.
256|Ray Bradbury|American writer|You have to know how to accept<br>rejection and reject acceptance.
257|Jane Champagne|Canadian painter|The effects of rejection can either kill<br>your muse or change your life.
258|Harley Brown|American artist|Do not take rejection personally … Every time you feel you’ve failed or have bruised feelings, crowd those thoughts out of your head with a personal moment that works … The art world is a series of daily adjustments …
259|Pablo Picasso|Spanish artist|I begin with an idea and then it<br>becomes something else.
260|Paul Klee|German and Swiss painter|A line is a dot that went for a walk.
261|Wassily Kandinsky|Russian painter|I applied streaks and blobs of colors onto the canvas with a palette knife, and I made them sing with all the intensity I could …
262|Andy Goldsworthy|English sculptor|The essence of drawing is the line exploring space.
263|Joan Miró|Spanish artist|Apply colors like words that shape<br>poems, like notes that shape music.
264|Wassily Kandinsky|Russian painter|Everything starts from a dot.
265|Vincent van Gogh|Dutch painter|It is not the language of painters but the language of nature which one should listen to the feeling for the things themselves, for reality, is more important than the feeling for pictures.
266|Leonardo da Vinci|Italian artist|Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
267|Wassily Kandinsky|Russian painter|Color is the keyboard<br>the eyes are the harmonies<br>the soul is the piano with<br>many strings. The artist is<br>the hand that plays, touching<br>one key or another, to cause<br>vibrations in the soul.
268|G. K. Chesterton|English writer|Art, like morality, consists of<br>drawing the line somewhere.
269|Ray Bradbury|American writer|When you write—explode—fly apart—<br>disintegrate\! Then give time enough to<br>think, cut, rework, and rewrite.
270|Ralph Waldo Emerson|American writer|Pictures must not be too picturesque.
271|Pablo Picasso|Spanish artist|There is no abstract art. You must always<br>start with something. Afterward you<br>can remove all traces of reality.
272|Pablo Casals|Spanish cellist and conductor|The most perfect technique is that<br>which is not noticed at all.
273|Gardner Cox|American painter|I do a bale of sketches, one eye, a piece of hair. A<br>pound of observation, then an ounce of painting.
274|T. S. Eliot|American-born English poet|Immature poets imitate mature poets steal.
275|Alexander Liberman|Russian-American artist|All art is solitary and the studio is a torture area.
276|Henri Matisse|French artist|It is only after years of preparation that<br>the young \[artist\] should touch color—<br>not color used descriptively, that is, but<br>as a means of personal expression.
277|Pablo Picasso|Spanish artist|For a long time I limited myself to one<br>color—as a form of discipline.
278|Paul Gauguin|French artist|With practice the craft will come almost of<br>itself, in spite of you and all the more easily if<br>you think of something besides technique.
279|Claude Monet|French painter|I’ve always refused requests, even from friends,<br>to employ a technique I know nothing about.
280|John Sloan|American artist|Find your own technique.
281|Pearl S. Buck|American writer|I don’t wait for moods. You accomplish<br>nothing if you do that. Your mind must<br>know it has to get down to work.
282|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|German writer|The right man is the one who seizes the moment.
283|Charles Baudelaire|French poet|Nothing can be done except little by little.
284|Robert Henri|American painter|Your painting is the marking of your progression into nature, a sensation of something you see way beyond the two pretty colors over there. Don’t stop to paint the material, but push on to give the spirit.
285|Robert Hughes|Australian art critic and writer|In art there is no progress, only<br>fluctuations of intensity.
286|Rainer Maria Rilke|Bohemian-Austrian poet|Allow your judgments a silent, undisturbed development, which, like all progress, must come from deep within and cannot be forced or hastened.
287|Kazuaki Tanahashi|Japanese writer and calligrapher|A painting works only on the edge of not<br>working. Then what is ungraspable comes near.
288|Marc Chagall|Russian-French artist|Great art picks up where nature ends.
289|Michelangelo|Italian artist|A man paints with his brains<br>and not with his hands.
290|Leonardo da Vinci|Italian artist|Obstacles cannot crush me<br>Every obstacle yields to<br>stern resolve. He who is<br>fixed to a star does not<br>change his mind.
291|Ansel Adams|American photographer|You don’t take a photograph, you make it.
292|Rembrandt van Rijn|Dutch painter|A painting is finished when the<br>artist says it is finished.
293|Jackson Pollock|American painter|When I am in my painting, I am not aware of what I’m doing. It is only after a sort of “get acquainted” period that I see what I have been about. I have no fears about making changes, destroying the image, etc., because the painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come through.
294|Zoe Benbow|English painter|Technique isn’t enough on its own—emotion has to come through—but when you’ve got the technique sewn up, that’s one thing you don’t have to worry about.
295|Robert Bissett|American artist|The beginning painter is focused on learning technique with the goal of accuracy. Then comes the realization that composition and design are more important.
296|Sergei Bongart|Ukrainian painter|Learn technique have full command to the extent of not being conscious of how it is done. When craftsmanship has been developed, you are free to create … technique will give way to expression\!
297|Harley Brown|American artist|Consider diversity of techniques within your<br>paintings. Pick and choose your areas and<br>then go with gusto … or refinement.
298|Robert Olen Butler|American writer|The only craft and technique you have legitimate access to is the craft and technique you forgot, that has dissolved itself into the unconscious … because you have learned it so well you have forgotten it.
299|Alvaro Castagnet|Spanish painter|Technique should be entirely subordinate<br>to the demands of your emotions.
300|George Carlson|American artist|Focusing totally on technique, you lose the essence and power of simplicity … The other extreme is just as bad you see it in a lot of Modern works, where the concept is more important than the technique, resulting in very poor craftsmanship.
301|Chen Chi|Chinese painter|The artist can know all the technique in the world,<br>but if he feels nothing, it will mean nothing.
302|Dean Taylor Drewyer|American artist|The human binocular and flickering<br>vision, coupled with the precious<br>imperfection of the human hand is where<br>art lives—there are no shortcuts.
303|Joe Garcia|American painter|The fun of painting is technique: loose opposite tight, texture versus wash, light against dark.
304|William Harvey|English engraver and designer|I want to paint as though my technique were invisible. I want my effort to be in the form and texture created by light, not brushstrokes.
305|Trevor Leggett|English writer and martial artist|First one specializes in technique, until he comes to the end of technique and bases everything on the heart itself—this is the best way of practice.
306|Claude Monet|French painter|Techniques<br>vary art stays the same: it is<br>a transposition of nature at<br>once forceful and sensitive.
307|Cornelis le Mair|Dutch painter|People often think that technical perfection has something to do with fine painting … Rembrandt, whose technique fascinated all great masters after a time, was said to have painted with a tarbrush. So he was not exactly a fine painter.
308|Kazimir Malevich|Russian painter|Everywhere there is craft and technique<br>everywhere there is artistry and form.<br>Art itself, technique, is ponderous and<br>clumsy, and because of its awkwardness<br>it obstructs that inner element …
309|Charles Movalli|American painter|The painterly painter avoids the how-<br>to approach, suspicious as ever that<br>technique will obscure his or her vision.
310|John Newberry|English painter|My technique, starting with a quick outline in pencil, is designed to record first impressions, with no time for second thoughts.
311|Kimon Nicolaïdes|Greek-American artist|Committing oneself to a technique<br>causes stagnation.
312|Walter J. Phillips|Canadian artist|When technique is obtrusive it becomes mere mannerism, a conscious striving for effect. It is only a means to an end—the manner of putting paint to paper. It hardly embraces the expressive side of painting.
313|Jackson Pollock|American painter|Technique is just a means of<br>arriving at a statement.
314|Sandy Sandy|American artist|It takes a long time to become<br>loose without losing it.
315|Randall Sexton|American painter|Theories<br>methods, and formulas aid in<br>the making of art, but each<br>artist’s technique comes more<br>from his or her personality<br>than anything else.
316|Nelson Shanks|American painter|If you find yourself with a weakness,<br>attack it … don’t develop a technique<br>that avoids your weaknesses.
317|Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki|Japanese writer|Technical knowledge is not enough.<br>One must transcend techniques<br>so that art becomes an artless art,<br>growing out of the unconscious.
318|Dan Thompson|American artist|No matter what techniques I use,<br>I still want to go after the eternal,<br>meaningful aspects of painting.
319|Andrew Wyeth|American artist|To be interested solely in technique would<br>be a very superficial thing to me.
320|Mary Todd Beam|American painter|Painting around an object will help<br>you look at your subjects in a new<br>way—as shapes and spaces …
321|Paul Brandford|English artist|Lines as edges kill a sense of form.
322|Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|French painter|The most important things in a painting<br>are Form and Value. Color comes<br>last—like a friend you welcome.
323|Harvey Dunn|American painter|Form is expressed in the light tones by dark<br>accents, in the dark tones by light accents.
324|Francisco de Goya|Spanish painter|I see only forms that are lit up and forms that<br>are not. There is only light and shadow.
325|Elliott Green|American artist|If a form isn’t right, if it’s erased, the<br>correction has meaning. It’s the process<br>of the mind, moving and making. The<br>form didn’t drop from outer space.
326|Wassily Kandinsky|Russian painter|The artist must have something to say, for<br>mastery over form is not his goal but rather<br>the adapting of form to its inner meaning.
327|Ellsworth Kelly|American artist|I’m not interested in edges. I’m interested in the mass and color, the black and white. The edges happen because the forms get as quiet as they can be. I want the masses to perform. When I work with forms and colors, I get the edge …
328|Henri Laurens|French sculptor|My aim is for<br>ripeness of form. I want to<br>make my forms so full, so<br>juicy, that one could add<br>nothing more to them.
329|Robert Motherwell|American painter|If you give a child something very complex to paint, such as a bouquet of flowers or a natural landscape, if he is very good, eventually he will get back—like Cézanne—to the essential forms of what he sees.
330|Pablo Picasso|Spanish artist|The secret of many of my deformations—which many people do not understand—is that there is an interaction, an intereffect between the lines in a painting: one line attracts the other and at the point of maximum attraction the lines curve in toward the attracting point and form is altered.
331|William F. Reese|American artist|No matter to what degree you carry the detail, it should always be secondary to the pattern. The form is what is important, not the story.
332|John Sloan|American artist|Draw with the brush. Carve the form. Don’t be carried away by subtleties of modeling and nice pigmentation at the expense of losing the form.
333|Deon Venter|South African artist|I have to be clear of the form before<br>I can really work out my problems<br>there in terms of composition.
334|Marion Boddy-Evans|Scottish painter|There’s no rule to say you must use only one<br>style in a painting. It’s entirely up to you. You’re<br>the artist you’re the boss it’s your painting.
335|Scott Menaul|American artist|Style is simply the adoption of an arbitrary<br>set of creative rules that one chooses from to<br>express oneself. One develops style as selected<br>preferences for each creative choice.
336|Frank Lloyd Wright|American architect|The mother art is architecture. Without<br>an architecture of our own, we have<br>no soul of our own civilization.
337|Le Corbusier|French architect|Architecture is the learned game, correct and<br>magnificent, of forms assembled in the light.
338|Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|German-American architect|Architecture starts when you carefully put<br>two bricks together. There it begins.
339|Louis Kahn|American architect|Architecture is the reaching out for the truth.
340|Louis Sullivan|American architect|Our architecture reflects truly as a mirror.
341|Walter Gropius|German architect|A modern, harmonic, and lively architecture<br>is the visible sign of an authentic democracy.
342|Frank Lloyd Wright|American architect|A great architect is not made by way of<br>a brain nearly so much as he is made by<br>way of a cultivated, enriched heart.
343|John Ruskin|English art critic|Architecture is the work of nations.
344|Christopher Wren|English architect|Architecture<br>aims at eternity.
345|Victor Hugo|French writer|Architecture has recorded the great<br>ideas of the human race. Not only every<br>religious symbol, but every human<br>thought has its page in that vast book.
346|Ralph Erskine|Swedish architect|The job of buildings is to improve<br>human relations.
347|Samuel Taylor Coleridge|English writer|The principle of Gothic architecture<br>is infinity made imaginable.
348|Constantin Brancusi|Romanian sculptor|Architecture is inhabited sculpture.
349|Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|American poet|Ah, to build, to build\! That is the<br>noblest of all the arts.
350|Walter Gropius|German architect|Architecture begins where engineering ends.
351|Michael Graves|American architect|Architecture is not all about the design<br>of the building and nothing else it is<br>also about the cultural setting and<br>the ambience, the whole affair.
352|Louis Sullivan|American architect|Form ever follows function.
353|Le Corbusier|French architect|To create architecture is to put in order. Put<br>what in order? Function and objects.
354|Roy Lichtenstein|American artist|I don’t think of form as a kind of architecture. The architecture is the result of the forming. It is the kinesthetic and visual sense of position and wholeness that puts the thing into the realm of art.
355|Maya Lin|American architect and artist|Even though I build buildings and I pursue my architecture, I pursue it as an artist. I deliberately keep a tiny studio. I don’t want to be an architectural firm. I want to remain an artist.
356|Arne Jacobsen|Danish architect|If a building becomes architecture, then it is art.
357|Guillaume Apollinaire|French writer|A structure becomes architectural, and<br>not sculptural, when its elements no longer<br>have their justification in nature.
358|Helmut Jahn|German-American architect|I strive for an architecture from which<br>nothing can be taken away.
359|John Ruskin|English art critic|An architect should live as little in cities as a painter. Send him to our hills, and let him study there what nature understands by a buttress, and what by a dome.
360|Kenneth Clark|English art critic|If I had to say which was telling the truth<br>about society, a speech by a Minister of<br>Housing or the actual buildings put up in<br>his time, I should believe the buildings.
361|Philip Johnson|American architect|All architects want to live beyond their deaths.
362|Ernest Dimnet|French writer|Architecture, of all the arts, is the one that acts<br>most slowly but the most surely on the soul.
363|Frank Gehry|Canadian-American architect|Architecture should speak of its time and<br>place, but yearn for timelessness.
364|Rembrandt van Rijn|Dutch painter|Painting is the<br>grandchild of nature.<br>It is related to God.
365|Simonides|ancient Greek poet|Painting is silent poetry,<br>and poetry is painting that speaks.
366|Pablo Picasso|Spanish artist|There are painters who transform the sun to a yellow spot, but there are others who, with the help of their art and their intelligence, transform a yellow spot into the sun.
367|Ambrose Bierce|American writer|Painting: The art of protecting flat surfaces from<br>the weather and exposing them to the critic.
368|John Singer Sargent|American painter|Every time I paint a portrait I lose a friend.
369|Edmond de Goncourt|French writer|A painting in a museum hears more ridiculous<br>opinions than anything else in the world.
370|Vincent van Gogh|Dutch painter|I experience a period of frightening clarity in those moments when nature is so beautiful. I am no longer sure of myself, and the paintings appear as in a dream.
371|Pablo Picasso|Spanish artist|Painting is just another way of keeping a diary.
372|Leonardo da Vinci|Italian artist|A good painter is to paint two main things,<br>men and the working of man’s mind.
373|Janice Tanton|Canadian artist|There are many things one thinks about<br>in a painting. Often, it’s how to handle<br>your chosen medium and how to best<br>reveal the light in a three-dimensional<br>form on a two-dimensional surface.
374|Georges Braque|French painter and sculptor|Painting is the nail to which I fasten my ideas.
375|Steven Wright|American actor|I’ve been doing a lot of abstract painting<br>lately, extremely abstract. No brush, no<br>paint, no canvas, I just think about it.
376|Jackson Pollock|American painter|Every good painter paints what he is.
377|Michelangelo|Italian artist|Good painting is the kind that<br>looks like sculpture.
378|William Cullen Bryant|American poet|A sculptor<br>wields the chisel, and<br>the stricken marble grows<br>to beauty.
379|Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|American poet|Sculpture is more divine, and more like Nature,<br>That fashions all her works in high relief,<br>And that is Sculpture.<br>This vast ball, the Earth,<br>Was molded out of clay, and baked in fire<br>Men, women, and all animals that breathe<br>Are statues, and not paintings.
380|Pablo Picasso|Spanish artist|Sculpture is the art of the intelligence.
381|Benvenuto Cellini|Italian artist|I say that the art of sculpture is eight<br>times as great as any other art based on<br>drawing, because a statue has eight views<br>and they must all be equally good.
382|Samuel Johnson|English writer|A fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make something in stone that hardly resembles a man. The value of statuary is owing to its difficulty. You would not value the finest head cut upon a carrot.
383|Auguste Rodin|French sculptor|As paradoxical as it may seem, a great sculptor is as much a colorist as the best painter, or rather the best engraver. He plays so skillfully with all the resources of relief, he blends so well the boldness of light with the modesty of shadow, that his sculptures please one as much as the most charming etchings.
384|Leonardo da Vinci|Italian artist|Sculpture, a very noble art, is one that does not in the execution require the same supreme ingenuity as the art of painting, since in two most important and difficult particulars, in foreshortening and in light and shade … the painter has to invent a process, \[whereas\] sculpture is helped by nature.
385|Henri Matisse|French artist|I did my sculpture as a painter. I did not work as a sculptor.
386|Henry Moore|English artist|A piece of sculpture can have a hole through<br>it and not be weakened if the hole is of a<br>studied size, shape, and direction.
387|William M. Dupree|American sculptor|There is no substitute for feeling the stone, the metal, the plaster, or the wood in the hand to feel its weight to feel its texture to struggle with it in the world rather than in the mind alone.
388|Aeschylus|ancient Greek playwright|Bronze is the mirror of the<br>form wine, of the heart.
389|Fritz Wotruba|Austrian sculptor|A hole in the block of a piece of sculpture<br>is in most cases nothing but the expression<br>of impotence and weakness.
390|Anish Kapoor|Indian-English sculptor|Sculpture<br>occupies the same space<br>as your body.
391|Jean Arp|German-French \(Alsatian\) artist|The essence of a sculpture must enter on tip-<br>toe, as light as animal footprints on snow.
392|Ralph Waldo Emerson|American writer|As picture teaches the coloring, so<br>sculpture the anatomy of form.
393|Michelangelo|Italian artist|A great sculpture can roll down<br>a hill without breaking.
394|Auguste Rodin|French sculptor|Sculpture is the art of the<br>hole and the lump.
395|Hap Hagood|American sculptor|Within every block of wood and stone,<br>there dwells a spirit, waiting to be released.<br>Direct carving is a way of freeing the spirit—<br>my own and that of the stone or wood.
396|Michelangelo|Italian artist|The stone unhewn and cold<br>Becomes a living mold.<br>The more the marble wastes,<br>The more the statue grows.
397|Gianlorenzo Bernini|Italian artist|There are two devices which can help the sculptor to judge his work: one is not to see it for a while. The other … is to look at his work through spectacles which will change its color and magnify or diminish it, so as to disguise it somehow to his eye, and make it look as though it were the work of another.
398|Auguste Rodin|French sculptor|Where did I learn to understand sculpture? In the woods by looking at the trees, along roads by observing the formation of clouds, in the studio by studying the model, everywhere except in the schools.
399|Maya Angelou|American writer|The idea is to<br>write it so that people hear it<br>and it slides through the brain<br>and goes straight to the heart.
400|Isaac Asimov|American writer|You must keep sending work out you must never let a manuscript do nothing but eat its head off in a drawer. You send that work out again and again, while you’re working on another one.
