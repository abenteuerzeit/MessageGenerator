# WORDS of ART

## Chapter 1

Art is the
greatest possible  
rationalization of our  
deepest fears, joys,  
and instincts as  
human beings.
**­Martha Mayer Erlebacher,** American painter

Art is the desire of a man to express  
himself, to record the reactions of his  
personality to the world he lives in.
**Amy Lowell**, American poet

I believe that if it were left to artists to choose  
their own labels, most would choose none.
**Ben Shahn**, Lithuanian-American artist

Let each man exercise the art he knows.
**Aristophanes**, ancient Greek playwright

When I can no longer create anything,  
I’ll be done for.
**Coco Chanel**, French fashion designer

Art is not what you see,  
but what you make others see.
**Edgar Degas**, French artist

To any artist, worthy of the name, all in nature is beautiful, because his eyes, fearlessly accepting all exterior truth, read there, as in an open book, all the inner truth.
**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

God is really only another artist. He invented the giraffe, the elephant, and the cat. He has no real style. He just keeps on trying other things.
**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

I don’t believe in total freedom for the artist. Left on his own, free to do anything he likes, the artist ends up doing nothing at all. If there’s one thing that’s dangerous for an artist, it’s precisely this question of total freedom, waiting for inspiration and all the rest of it.
**Federico Fellini**, Italian director

The critic has to educate the public;  
the artist has to educate the critic.
**Oscar Wilde**, Irish writer

Art is not a handicraft; it is the transmission  
of feeling the artist has experienced.
**Leo Tolstoy**, Russian writer

Every artist was first an amateur.
**Ralph Waldo Emerson**, American writer

The artist is the confidant of nature; flowers carry on dialogues with him through the graceful bending of their stems and the harmoniously tinted nuances of their blossoms. Every flower has a cordial word, which nature directs towards him.
**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

What I dream of is an art of balance.
**Henri Matisse**, French artist

In my experience, anyone can  
paint if he doesn’t have to.

Through all the world there goes one  
long cry from the heart of the artist:  
Give me leave to do my utmost.
**Isak Dinesen**, Danish writer

The painting has a life of its own.  
I try to let it come through.
**Jackson Pollock**, American painter

I say that good painters imitated nature,  
but that bad ones vomited it.
**Miguel de Cervantes**, Spanish writer

Art is either plagiarism or revolution.
**Paul Gauguin**, French artist

I paint my own reality
The only thing I know is that  
I paint because I need to,  
and I paint whatever passes  
through my head without any  
other consideration.
**Frida Kahlo**, Mexican painter

The position of the artist is humble.  
He is essentially a channel.
**Piet Mondrian**, Dutch painter

Art is making something out of nothing and selling it.
**Frank Zappa**, American musician

The artist is not a reporter, but a Great  
Teacher. It is not his business to depict  
the world as it is, but as it ought to be.
**H. L. Mencken**, American writer

Every child is an artist. The problem is how  
to remain an artist once he grows up.
**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

An artist observes, selects,  
guesses, and synthesizes.
**Anton Chekhov**, Russian writer

I don’t paint things. I only paint the  
difference between things.
**Henri Matisse**, French artist

An amateur is someone who supports  
himself with outside jobs, which enable  
him to paint. A professional is someone  
whose wife works to enable him to paint.
**Ben Shahn**, Lithuanian-American artist

Blessed are they who see beautiful things in  
humble places where other people see nothing.
**Camille Pissarro**, French painter

Only when he no longer knows what he is  
doing does the painter do good things.
**Edgar Degas**, French artist

The artist need not know very much; best  
of all let him work instinctively and paint  
as naturally as he breathes or walks.

I am an artist … I am here to live out loud.
**Émile Zola**, French writer

The artist is the antenna of the race.
**Ezra Pound**, American-born writer

Artists who seek perfection in everything are  
those who cannot attain it in anything.
**Eugène Delacroix**, French artist

There are two men inside the artist, the  
poet and the craftsman. One is born a  
poet. One becomes a craftsman.
**Émile Zola**, French writer

The artist is nothing without the gift,  
but the gift is nothing without work.
**Émile Zola**, French writer

We all have the ability … we just don’t  
all have the courage to follow our  
dreams and to follow the signs.
**Paulo Coelho**, Brazilian writer

You can’t make an architect. But you can open the doors and windows toward the light as you see it.
**Frank Lloyd Wright**, American architect

If art was defined simply by the ability  
to draw, then my inkjet printer would be  
a greater artist than Michelangelo.
**Curtis Verdun**, American painter

The artist must train not only  
his eye, but also his soul.
**Wassily Kandinsky**, Russian painter

If I didn’t think what I was doing had  
something to do with enlarging the  
boundaries of art, I wouldn’t go on doing it.
**Claes Oldenburg**, American sculptor

A good painter has two main objects to paint, man and the intention of his soul. The former is easy, the latter hard, as he has to represent it by the attitude and movement of the limbs.
**Leonardo da Vinci**, Italian artist

Art is a collaboration
between God and the artist,  
and the less the artist  
does, the better.
**André Gide**, French writer

To the artist there is never  
anything ugly in nature.
**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

The artist must create a spark before he  
can make a fire, and before art is born,  
the artist must be ready to be consumed  
by the fire of his own creation.
**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

An artist is not paid for his labor but for his vision.
**James McNeill Whistler**, American painter

The big artist … keeps an eye on  
nature and steals her tools.
**Thomas Eakins**, American painter

An artist needn’t be a clergyman or a  
churchwarden, but he certainly must  
have a warm heart for his fellow men.
**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

I tell you, the more I think, the more  
I feel that there is nothing more truly  
artistic than to love people.
**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

I paint in order not to cry.
**Paul Klee**, German-Swiss painter

Great authors are admirable in this  
respect: in every generation they make  
for disagreement. Through them we  
become aware of our differences.
**André Gide**, French writer

Love the art in yourself, not yourself in the art.
**Konstantin Stanislavsky**, Russian actor

You see what you know!
**Frank Stella**, Italian-American artist

There is no such thing as talent. What they  
call talent is nothing but the capacity for  
doing continuous work in the right way.
**Winslow Homer**, American painter

Painting is easy for those that do not know  
how, but very difficult for those that do!
**Edgar Degas**, French artist

The world today doesn’t make sense, so  
why should I paint pictures that do?
**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

The aim of every artist is to arrest motion, which is life, by artificial means and hold it fixed so that a hundred years later, when a stranger looks at it, it moves again since it is life.
**William Faulkner**, American writer

To send light into the darkness of men’s  
hearts—such is the duty of the artist.
**Robert Schumann**, German composer

We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize truth, at least the truth that is given us to understand. The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies.
**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

The artist’s world is limitless. It can be found  
anywhere, far from where he lives or a few  
feet away. It is always on his doorstep.
**Paul Strand**, American photographer

Every portrait that is painted with feeling is  
a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.
**Oscar Wilde**, Irish writer

It is a mistake for a sculptor or a painter to  
speak or write very often about his job. It  
releases tension needed for his work.
**Henry Moore**, English sculptor

The artist is the opposite of the politically minded individual, the opposite of the reformer, the opposite of the idealist. The artist does not tinker with the universe; he re-creates it out of his own experience and understanding of life.
**Henry Miller**, American playwright

No great artist ever sees things as they really  
are. If he did, he would cease to be an artist.
**Oscar Wilde**, Irish writer

An artist is a dreamer consenting  
to dream of the actual world.
**George Santayana**, Spanish writer

An artist’s career always begins tomorrow.
**James McNeill Whistler**, American painter

The artist is a receptacle for the emotions that come from all over the place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spider’s web.
**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

The true painter strives to paint what  
can only be seen through his world.
**André Malraux**, French writer

An artist cannot talk about his art any more  
than a plant can discuss horticulture.
**Jean Cocteau**, French writer

For the mystic what is how. For the craftsman  
how is what. For the artist what and how are one.

above all, men who want to  
become inhuman.
**Guillaume Apollinaire**, French writer

All works of art are commissioned in the sense that no artist can create one by a simple act of will but must wait until what he believes to be a good idea for a work comes to him.
**W. H. Auden**, Anglo-American poet

Artists are fiery; they do not weep\!
**Ludwig van Beethoven**, German composer

The artist is the person who makes life  
more interesting or beautiful, more  
understandable or mysterious, or probably,  
in the best sense, more wonderful.
**George Bellows**, American painter

We artists are the first to see the light at  
the end of the chaotic tunnels we all live  
in, and we dare to move toward it.
**Eleanor Blair**, American artist

The nation is bound together by its creative  
artists and not by parallel lines of rusting steel.
**Pierre Berton**, Canadian writer

An artist is like a prophet. He must lead people  
and help them get acquainted with what he sees.
**George Buytendorp**, Canadian artist

He who desires nothing, hopes for nothing,  
and is afraid of nothing, cannot be an artist.
**Anton Chekhov**, Russian writer

When the artist is alive in any person … he becomes an inventive, searching, daring, self-expressing creature. He becomes interesting to other people. He disturbs, upsets, enlightens, and he opens ways for better understanding.
**Robert Henri**, American painter

As artists we are manifesting thought  
into reality every time we create.
**Cristina Acosta**, American artist

Artists express their own soul through their  
paintings. It is, perhaps, an affirmation of  
who we really are—as art rarely lies.
**Jack Dickerson**, American painter

The artists must be sacrificed to their  
art. Like the bees, they must put their  
lives into the sting they give.
**Ralph Waldo Emerson**, American writer

Artists are just children who refuse  
to put down their crayons.
**Al Hirschfeld**, American artist

The artist
must say it without saying it.
**Duke Ellington**, American musician

An artist is a creature driven by demons—  
he usually doesn’t know why they chose him  
and he’s usually too busy to wonder why.
**William Faulkner**, American writer

Artists don’t make objects.  
Artists make mythologies.
**Anish Kapoor**, Indian-English sculptor

The great artist is a formulation of the greatest intelligence: he is the recipient of sensations which are the most delicate and consequently the most invisible expressions of the brain.
**Paul Gauguin**, French artist

The main difference between the average person and the “Artist” is the focused drive. An Artist is driven sometimes to the exclusion of all else … often has to be reminded to join the rest of the world once in a while.
**Sandra Taylor Hedges**, Canadian artist

Every significant artist is a metaphysician, a  
propounder of beauty-truths and form-theories.
**Aldous Huxley**, English writer

To be an artist means never to avert one’s eyes.
**Akira Kurosawa**, Japanese filmmaker

## CHAPTER 2

### Passion,\*\*

**Inspiration,**  
**and**  
\*\*Imagination

What is a sketch but a moment’s  
passion, searching for the truth.

**Stephen Aitken**, American artist

If painting is no longer needed, it seems a  
pity that some of us are born into the world  
with such a passion for line and color.

**Mary Cassatt**, American painter

The passion … is transmuted during the  
act of painting from rage to euphoria.

**Jane Champagne**, Canadian painter

Passion, though a bad regulator,  
is a powerful spring.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson**, American writer

Through some memory, feeling, experience,  
the passion wells up and spills into my  
palette; it mixes with my paint. And the paint  
tells me what to do. I listen. I act on it.

**Ann Dettmer**, American painter

Whether you are painting or singing or acting  
or dancing, do it with passion, do it every day,  
and do it like you don’t need the money.

**John Ferrie**, Canadian artist

The creation of art is the passion. The completion  
of art only ignites another creation.

**Jeffrey Breslow**, American sculptor

Sometimes there are rare golden moments, moments of bliss and dreamlike poetry … That’s what gives me my passion and the fuel I need to continue moving paint across a fresh, waiting canvas.

**Eric Frantz**, American artist

Art is a passion or it is nothing.

**Roger Fry**, English artist and critic

Expression is not a matter of passion  
mirrored on the human face or revealed  
by a violent gesture. When I paint a  
picture, its every detail is expressive.

**Henri Matisse**, French artist

It’s a curse. Yes, it’s a flame. It owns you. It has  
possession over you. You are not the master  
of yourself. You are consumed by this thing.

**Henry Miller**, American playwright

Technique alone is never enough. You  
have to have passion. Technique alone  
is just an embroidered potholder.

**Raymond Chandler**, American writer

Painting, like passion, is a living voice.

**Barnett Newman**, American artist

## \*\*Imagination

is the beginning of creation.  
You imagine what you desire;  
you will what you imagine;  
and at last you create what you will.\*\*

**George Bernard Shaw**, Irish playwright

No amount of skillful invention can replace  
the essential element of imagination.

**Edward Hopper**, American painter

Art is everywhere, except it has to  
pass through a creative mind.

**Louise Nevelson**, American sculptor

The work of art must seize upon you, wrap you up in itself, and carry you away. It is the means by which the artist conveys his passion. It is the current which he puts forth, which sweeps you along in his passion.

**Pierre-Auguste Renoir**, French painter

If you can’t find your inspiration by  
walking around the block one time, go  
around two blocks—but never three.

**Robert Motherwell**, American painter

What I dream of is an art of equilibrium,  
purity, and tranquility, devoid of upsetting  
or troubling subject matter …

**Henri Matisse**, French artist

Art must be an expression of love or it is nothing.

**Marc Chagall**, Russian-French artist

The source of genius is imagination alone,  
the refinement of the senses that sees what  
others do not see, or sees them differently.

**Eugène Delacroix**, French artist

A work of art which did not begin  
in emotion is not art.

**Paul Cézanne**, French artist

I shut my eyes in order to see.

**Paul Gauguin**, French artist

Painting from nature is not copying the  
object; it is realizing one’s sensations.

**Paul Cézanne**, French artist

In art the hand can never execute anything  
higher than the heart can inspire.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson**, American writer

I put my heart and my soul into my work,  
and have lost my mind in the process.

**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

I found I could say things with color  
and shapes that I couldn’t say any other  
way—things I had no words for.

**Georgia O’Keeffe**, American painter

It takes a very long time to become young.

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

And those who were seen dancing were thought to  
be insane by those who could not hear the music.

**Friedrich Nietzsche**, German writer and philosopher

An empty canvas is a living wonder …  
far lovelier than certain pictures.

**Wassily Kandinsky**, Russian painter

Everyone wants to understand  
painting. Why is there no attempt to  
understand the song of the birds?

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

Inspiration exists, but it has to find us working.

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

Arrange what pieces come your way.

**Virginia Woolf**, English writer

The real voyage of discovery consists not in  
seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.

**Marcel Proust**, French writer

You can’t depend on your eyes when  
your imagination is out of focus.

**Mark Twain**, American writer

Where the spirit does not work with  
the hand, there is no art.

**Leonardo da Vinci**, Italian artist

All art is but imitation of nature.

**Lucius Annaeus Seneca**, ancient Roman dramatist

Those who do not want to imitate  
anything, produce nothing.

**Salvador Dalí**, Spanish painter

Art happens all the time, everywhere. All  
we have to do is to keep our minds open.

**Jacek Tylicki**, Polish-American artist

There is nothing more difficult for a truly  
creative painter than to paint a rose, because  
before he can do so, he has first to forget  
all the roses that were ever painted.

**Henri Matisse**, French artist

They thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn’t. I  
never painted dreams. I painted my reality.

**Frida Kahlo**, Mexican painter

What I give form to in daylight is only one  
percent of what I have seen in darkness.

**M. C. Escher**, Dutch artist

A subject that is beautiful in itself gives no  
suggestion to the artist. It lacks imperfection.

**Oscar Wilde**, Irish writer

Without passion man is a mere latent force and  
possibility, like the flint which awaits the shock  
of the iron before it can give forth its spark.

**Henri-Frédéric Amiel**, Swiss poet

## \*\*Passion

should overwhelm reason  
time and again.\*\*

**Alvaro Castagnet**, Spanish painter

Passion makes a person stop eating, sleeping, working, feeling at peace. A lot of people are frightened because, when it appears, it demolishes all the old things it finds in its path.

**Paulo Coelho**, Brazilian writer

When I’m ready to make a photograph … I quite obviously see in my mind’s eye something that is not literally there … I’m interested in something which is built up from within, rather than just extracted from without.

**Ansel Adams**, American photographer

Absent imagination and artistic vision, we  
are blind to the wonders of creation.

**David Allio**, American photographer

Imagination is the highest kite one can fly.

**Lauren Bacall**, American actress

Don’t play what’s there; play what’s not there.

**Miles Davis**, American musician

Artists are supposed to be the ones with  
imagination. A good part of our job description  
is to get regular people to use theirs.

**Robert Genn**, Canadian painter

Do not quench your inspiration and  
your imagination; do not become  
the slave of your model.

**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

Imagination abandoned by reason produces impossible monsters; united with it, she is the mother of the arts and the source of their wonders.

**Francisco de Goya**, Spanish painter

Harness the imagination,  
for she is the whole of happiness.

**Baltasar Gracián**, Spanish writer

An artist who has no imagination is a mechanic.

**Robert Henri**, American painter

It is not enough to know your craft—you  
have to have feeling. Science is all very well,  
but for us imagination is worth far more.

**Édouard Manet**, French painter

I saw the angel in the marble and  
carved until I set him free.

**Michelangelo**, Italian artist

Imagination is the true magic carpet.

**Norman Vincent Peale**, American writer

Those who dream by day are cognizant  
of many things which escape those  
who dream only by night.

**Edgar Allan Poe**, American writer

This world of the imagination is fancy-free  
and violently opposed to common sense.

**Mark Rothko**, Russian-American painter

## \*\*Everything

you can imagine is real.\*\*

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

The world of reality has its limits; the  
world of imagination is boundless.

**Jean-Jacques Rousseau**, Swiss writer

A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the  
moment a single man contemplates it, bearing  
within him the image of a cathedral.

**Antoine de Saint-Exupéry**, French writer

One supreme fact which I have discovered  
is that it is not willpower, but fantasy-  
imagination that creates. Imagination is the  
creative force. Imagination creates reality.

**Richard Wagner**, German composer

If there is truth in art, it is the artist’s  
own truth. If beauty is involved, it is  
only the metaphor of imagination.

**David Smith**, American sculptor

The world is but a canvas to the imagination.

**Henry David Thoreau**, American writer

In my mind I have finer pictures than ever  
before. Ten thousand pictures come and go  
every day, and those are the only complete  
pictures painted, pictures that shall never  
be polluted by paint and canvas.

**John H. Twachtman**, American painter

You cannot hear the waterfall if you stand  
next to it. I paint my jungles in the desert.

**Macedonio de la Torre**, Peruvian painter

The idea or the faculty of imagination serves as  
both rudder and bridle to the senses, inasmuch  
as the thing imagined moves the sense.

**Leonardo da Vinci**, Italian artist

There are moments when a man’s imagination,  
so easily subdued to what it lives in,  
suddenly rises above its daily level and  
surveys the long windings of destiny.

**Edith Wharton**, American writer

I’m not inspired every day I go to the studio, but you’ve got to push yourself. Do it every day and once in a while things will really click. That’s the biggest high you can imagine.

**Jamie Wyeth**, American artist

I am convinced that there are universal  
currents of Divine Thought vibrating the  
ether everywhere and that any who can  
feel these vibrations is inspired …

**Richard Wagner**, German composer

Inspiration demands the active cooperation of the intellect joined with enthusiasm, and it is under such conditions that marvelous conceptions, with all that is excellent and divine, come into being.

**Giorgio Vasari**, Italian artist

Our moments of inspiration are not lost, though we have no particular poem to show for them; for those experiences have left an indelible impression, and we are ever and anon reminded of them.

**Henry David Thoreau**, American writer

You can’t cross the sea merely by  
standing and staring at the water.

**Rabindranath Tagore**, Bengali artist

What distinguishes a great artist from a weak one is first their sensibility and tenderness; second, their imagination; and third, their industry.

**John Ruskin**, English art critic

Never leave a painting mediocre; it’s  
better to take a chance with it.

**Guy Corriero**, American painter

Do not worry about your originality. You  
could not get rid of it even if you wanted to.

**Robert Henri**, American painter

The main thing is to be moved, to  
love, to hope, to tremble, to live.

**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

## CHAPTER 3

###### Overcoming\*\*

**Fear and**  
\*\*Failure

To create one’s own world in any  
of the arts takes courage.

**Georgia O’Keeffe**, American painter

One must from time to time attempt  
things that are beyond one’s capacity.

**Pierre-Auguste Renoir**, French painter

One day seven years ago I found myself saying to myself—I can’t live where I want to—I can’t go where I want to go—I can’t do what I want to—I can’t even say what I want to … I decided I was a very stupid fool not to at least paint as I wanted to.

**Georgia O’Keeffe**, American painter

Unless you try to do something beyond what you  
have already mastered, you will never grow.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson**, American writer

In spite of everything I shall rise again:  
I will take up my pencil, which I have  
forsaken in my great discouragement,  
and I will go on with my drawing.

**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

The only cats worth anything are the cats who take chances. Sometimes I play things that I never heard myself.

**Thelonius Monk**, American musician

## \*\*Rejection

is part of the job description  
for anyone in the arts … one  
must have a sense of purpose  
… of where you want to go  
with your art, and no one  
decides that but you. Seek  
relevance instead of approval.\*\*

**Jackie Knott**, American painter

It is better to be hated for what you are  
than to be loved for what you are not.

**André Gide**, French writer

Nothing is a waste of time if you  
use the experience wisely.

**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

A beautiful thing never gives so much  
pain as does failing to hear and see it.

**Michelangelo**, Italian artist

Every creator painfully experiences  
the chasm between his inner vision  
and its ultimate expression.

**Isaac Bashevis Singer**, Jewish-American author

Sometimes, to pursue a new idea, the artist  
must forfeit his deposit on an old idea.

**Robert Breault**, American operatic tenor

All great art comes from a sense of outrage.

**Glenn Close**, American actress

There are many victories worse than a defeat.

**George Eliot**, English writer

To be an artist is to fail, as no other dare fail …  
failure is his world and to shrink from it  
desertion …

**Samuel Beckett**, Irish writer

Listen carefully to first criticisms made of your work. Note just what it is about your work that critics don’t like—then cultivate it. That’s the only part of your work that’s individual and worth keeping.

**Jean Cocteau**, French writer

Above all, it’s hard learning to live with vivid mental images of scenes I cared for and failed to photograph. It is the edgy existence within me of these unmade images that is the only assurance that the best photographs are yet to be made.

**Sam Abell**, American photographer

They who have conquered doubt and  
fear have conquered failure.

**James Allen**, English writer

Rejection can disappoint you, depress you, and may even stop you in your tracks … learn not to take rejection so personally … if you’re honest with yourself and believe in your work, others will too.

**Bev Jozwiak**, American painter

If you’re not failing every now and again, it’s a  
sign you’re not doing anything very innovative.

**Woody Allen**, American filmmaker

Ever tried? Ever failed? No matter. Try  
Again. Fail again. Fail better.

**Samuel Beckett**, Irish writer

You fail only if you stop …

**Ray Bradbury**, American writer

A minute’s success pays the failure of years.

**Robert Browning**, English poet

Some of the biggest failures I  
ever had were successes.

**Pearl S. Buck**, American writer

## \*\*Failure is the

condiment that gives  
success its flavor.\*\*

**Truman Capote**, American writer

One must be a god to be able to tell successes  
from failures without making a mistake.

**Anton Chekhov**, Russian writer

An artist, a man, a failure, must proceed.

**E. E. Cummings**, American poet

I’m proof against that word _failure_. I’ve  
seen behind it. The only failure a man ought to  
fear is failure of cleaving to  
the purpose he sees to be best.

**George Eliot**, English writer

Even the knowledge of my own fallibility  
cannot keep me from making mistakes.  
Only when I fall do I get up again.

**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

He who is discouraged after a  
failure is not a real artist.

**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

What separates artists from ex-artists  
is that those who challenge their fears  
continue; those who don’t, quit.

**David Bayles**, American photographer

Don’t give in to your fears. If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.

**Paulo Coelho**, Brazilian writer

I am the first to be surprised and often terrified  
by the images that I see appear on my canvas.

**Salvador Dalí**, Spanish painter

Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after  
that, fear has no power, and the fear of  
freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free.

**Jim Morrison**, American musician

Without fear and illness, I could never  
have accomplished all I have.

**Edvard Munch**, Norwegian painter

I sometimes have a horrible fear of turning up a canvas of mine. I’m always afraid of finding a monster in place of the precious jewels I thought I had put there\!

**Camille Pissarro**, French painter

The only thing I fear more than change  
is no change. The business of being static  
makes me nuts.

**Twyla Tharp**, American dancer and choreographer

It is necessary to put yourself out for rejection,  
and accept that you will be rejected.

**Robert Genn**, Canadian artist

## \*\*Fear is the enemy

of art. But it’s a misfortune to  
be in complete control and a  
gift to feel slightly lost.\*\*

**Melanie Peter**, American artist

Insecurity prevents young artists from “flying” and older artists from being “down to earth.” Young artists should work on their confidence and the older ones on their humility.

**Igor Babailov**, Russian-American artist

Ask for no guarantees; ask for no security; there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth, which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life away.

**Ray Bradbury**, American writer

One does not discover new lands  
without consenting to lose sight of  
the shore for a very long time.

**André Gide**, French writer

Just dash something down if you see a blank canvas staring at you with a certain imbecility. You do not know how paralyzing it is, that staring of a blank canvas, which says to the painter: you don’t know anything.

**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

In a world we find terrifying, we ratify  
that which doesn’t threaten us.

**David Mamet**, American playwright

I still believe that at any time the no-  
talent police will come and arrest me.

**Mike Myers**, Canadian actor

I always have a curious sort of feeling about some of my things—I hate to show them—I am perfectly inconsistent about it—I am afraid people won’t understand—and I hope they won’t—and am afraid they will.

**Georgia O’Keeffe**, American painter

We spend our time searching for  
security and hate it when we get it.

**John Steinbeck**, American writer

Oh, you weak, beautiful people who give  
up with such grace. What you need is  
someone to take hold of you—gently, with  
love, and hand your life back to you.

**Tennessee Williams**, American playwright

When I paint, I liberate monsters … They are the manifestations of all the doubts, searches, and groping for meaning and expression which all artists experience … One does not choose the content; one submits to it.

**Pierre Alechinsky**, Belgian artist

I am no artist—please come and help me.

**Michelangelo**, Italian artist

I still don’t know where I am  
going to sleep tomorrow.

**Claude Monet**, French painter

Being true to yourself is what feeds  
creativity, not self-doubt and criticism.

**Diane Arenberg**, American artist

If the Sun and Moon should ever  
doubt, they’d immediately go out.

**William Blake**, English poet

Doubt, of whatever kind, can be ended  
by action alone.

**Thomas Carlyle**, Scottish writer

Doubt is a pain too lonely to know  
that faith is his twin brother.

**Kahlil Gibran**, Lebanese-American writer and artist

## \*\*Doubt whom you will

but never yourself.\*\*

**Christian Nestell Bovee**, American author

I felt so insufficiently equipped, so unprepared, so weak, and at the same time it seemed to me that my reflections on art were correct. I quarreled with all the world and with myself.

**Edgar Degas**, French artist

What still concerns me the most is: am I  
on the right track; am I making progress;  
am I making mistakes in art?

**Paul Gauguin**, French artist

Every work of art has its necessity; find out your very own. Ask yourself if you would do it if nobody would ever see it, if you would never be compensated for it, if nobody ever wanted it. If you come to a clear “yes” in spite of it, then go ahead and don’t doubt it anymore.

**Ernst Haas**, Austrian artist

But perhaps my art is the art of a lunatic,  
I thought, mere glittering quicksilver, a  
blue soul breaking in upon my pictures.

**Marc Chagall**, Russian-French artist

The greater the artist, the greater the  
doubt. Perfect confidence is given to the  
less talented as a consolation prize.

**Robert Hughes**, Australian art critic and writer

Doubts must be resolved alone within  
the soul. Otherwise one would profane  
one’s own powerful solution.

**Wassily Kandinsky**, Russian painter

As long as I keep getting rejected, I know  
I must be doing something right.

**Suzanne Partridge**, English painter

I think it’s the people who have no doubt  
that every word they put down is gold  
that probably don’t write very well.

**Dean Koontz**, American author

Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the  
good we oft might win by fearing to attempt.

**William Shakespeare**, English writer

That painter who has no doubts will achieve little.

**Leonardo da Vinci**, Italian artist

## \*\*Anxiety is the

handmaiden of creativity.\*\*

**T. S. Eliot**, American-born English poet

The analytical left brain not only breaks the painting into its components; it is also the doubter, the inhibitor, and the one that doesn’t want to ruin the painting.

**Marney Ward**, Canadian artist

Doubt is a central factor all the time. There’s always the doubt: What the hell am I doing out here in the middle of the woods, all alone, painting?

**Neil Welliver**, American artist

I know very well what I am about and that my skies have not been neglected, though they often failed in execution—and often no doubt from over-anxiety about them …

**John Constable**, English painter

Into each life some rain must fall; some  
days must be dark and dreary.

**Henry Wadsworth Longfellow**, American poet

He that respects himself is safe from others;  
he wears a coat of mail that none can pierce.

**Henry Wadsworth Longfellow**, American poet

No one but myself knows the anxiety I go  
through and the trouble I give myself to  
finish paintings which do not satisfy me  
and seem to please so very few others.

**Claude Monet**, French painter

What I say to an artist is, “When  
you can’t paint—paint.”

**Joyce Cary**, Anglo-Irish writer and artist

When I start to paint, it is real agony. I get nervous. The day before, I am already working up to it. Then I get to the studio and, once the image starts to emerge and come together, pleasure kicks in. And then you can see things that no other person can see.

**Luc Tuymans**, Belgian artist

Those who are willing to be vulnerable  
move among mysteries.

**Theodore Roethke**, American poet

Instead of “What ever made me think I  
was a painter?” change it to “What made  
me a painter? Let me count the ways.”

**Jane Champagne**, Canadian painter

People need trouble—a little frustration to sharpen the spirit on, toughen it. Artists do; I don’t mean you need to live in a rat hole or gutter, but you have to learn fortitude, endurance. Only vegetables are happy.

**William Faulkner**, American writer

Most success springs from an obstacle or failure. I became a cartoonist largely because I failed in my goal of becoming a successful executive.

**Scott Adams**, American cartoonist

Success is often achieved by those who  
don’t know that failure is inevitable.

**Coco Chanel**, French fashion designer

Sometimes a noble failure serves the world  
as faithfully as a distinguished success.

**Edward Dowden**, Irish poet

Failure after long perseverance is much  
grander than never to have a striving  
good enough to be called a failure.

**George Eliot**, English writer

The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it—so fine that we often are on the line and do not know it.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson**, American writer

I’ve failed again\!

**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound, rebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal.

**Napoleon Hill**, American writer

If you can’t paint, paint big.

**Audrey Flack**, American artist

Whether or not your work was included  
in this show should not discourage you  
from continuing your artistic pursuits.

**Jane Fulton Alt**, American photographer

You have to know how to accept  
rejection and reject acceptance.

**Ray Bradbury**, American writer

The effects of rejection can either kill  
your muse or change your life.

**Jane Champagne**, Canadian painter

Do not take rejection personally … Every time you feel you’ve failed or have bruised feelings, crowd those thoughts out of your head with a personal moment that works … The art world is a series of daily adjustments …

**Harley Brown**, American artist

## CHAPTER 4

###### Process

I begin with an idea and then it  
becomes something else.

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

A line is a dot that went for a walk.

**Paul Klee**, German and Swiss painter

I applied streaks and blobs of colors onto the canvas with a palette knife, and I made them sing with all the intensity I could …

**Wassily Kandinsky**, Russian painter

The essence of drawing is the line exploring space.

**Andy Goldsworthy**, English sculptor

Apply colors like words that shape  
poems, like notes that shape music.

**Joan Miró**, Spanish artist

Everything starts from a dot.

**Wassily Kandinsky**, Russian painter

It is not the language of painters but the language of nature which one should listen to; the feeling for the things themselves, for reality, is more important than the feeling for pictures.

**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

**Leonardo da Vinci**, Italian artist

## \*\*Color is the keyboard

the eyes are the harmonies;  
the soul is the piano with  
many strings. The artist is  
the hand that plays, touching  
one key or another, to cause  
vibrations in the soul.\*\*

**Wassily Kandinsky**, Russian painter

Art, like morality, consists of  
drawing the line somewhere.

**G. K. Chesterton**, English writer

When you write—explode—fly apart—  
disintegrate\! Then give time enough to  
think, cut, rework, and rewrite.

**Ray Bradbury**, American writer

Pictures must not be too picturesque.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson**, American writer

There is no abstract art. You must always  
start with something. Afterward you  
can remove all traces of reality.

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

The most perfect technique is that  
which is not noticed at all.

**Pablo Casals**, Spanish cellist and conductor

I do a bale of sketches, one eye, a piece of hair. A  
pound of observation, then an ounce of painting.

**Gardner Cox**, American painter

Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal.

**T. S. Eliot**, American-born English poet

All art is solitary and the studio is a torture area.

**Alexander Liberman**, Russian-American artist

It is only after years of preparation that  
the young \[artist\] should touch color—  
not color used descriptively, that is, but  
as a means of personal expression.

**Henri Matisse**, French artist

For a long time I limited myself to one  
color—as a form of discipline.

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

With practice the craft will come almost of  
itself, in spite of you and all the more easily if  
you think of something besides technique.

**Paul Gauguin**, French artist

I’ve always refused requests, even from friends,  
to employ a technique I know nothing about.

**Claude Monet**, French painter

Find your own technique.

**John Sloan**, American artist

I don’t wait for moods. You accomplish  
nothing if you do that. Your mind must  
know it has to get down to work.

**Pearl S. Buck**, American writer

The right man is the one who seizes the moment.

**Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, German writer, artist**, and politician Nothing can be done except little by little.

**Charles Baudelaire**, French poet

Your painting is the marking of your progression into nature, a sensation of something you see way beyond the two pretty colors over there. Don’t stop to paint the material, but push on to give the spirit.

**Robert Henri**, American painter

In art there is no progress, only  
fluctuations of intensity.

**Robert Hughes**, Australian art critic and writer

Allow your judgments a silent, undisturbed development, which, like all progress, must come from deep within and cannot be forced or hastened.

**Rainer Maria Rilke**, Bohemian-Austrian poet

A painting works only on the edge of not  
working. Then what is ungraspable comes near.

**Kazuaki Tanahashi**, Japanese writer and calligrapher Great art picks up where nature ends.

**Marc Chagall**, Russian-French artist

A man paints with his brains  
and not with his hands.

**Michelangelo**, Italian artist

## \*\*Obstacles cannot crush me

Every obstacle yields to  
stern resolve. He who is  
fixed to a star does not  
change his mind.\*\*

**Leonardo da Vinci**, Italian artist

You don’t take a photograph, you make it.

**Ansel Adams**, American photographer

A painting is finished when the  
artist says it is finished.

**Rembrandt van Rijn**, Dutch painter

When I am in my painting, I am not aware of what I’m doing. It is only after a sort of “get acquainted” period that I see what I have been about. I have no fears about making changes, destroying the image, etc., because the painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come through.

**Jackson Pollock**, American painter

Technique isn’t enough on its own—emotion has to come through—but when you’ve got the technique sewn up, that’s one thing you don’t have to worry about.

**Zoe Benbow**, English painter

The beginning painter is focused on learning technique with the goal of accuracy. Then comes the realization that composition and design are more important.

**Robert Bissett**, American artist

Learn technique; have full command to the extent of not being conscious of how it is done. When craftsmanship has been developed, you are free to create … technique will give way to expression\!

**Sergei Bongart**, Ukrainian painter

Consider diversity of techniques within your  
paintings. Pick and choose your areas and  
then go with gusto … or refinement.

**Harley Brown**, American artist

The only craft and technique you have legitimate access to is the craft and technique you forgot, that has dissolved itself into the unconscious … because you have learned it so well you have forgotten it.

**Robert Olen Butler**, American writer

Technique should be entirely subordinate  
to the demands of your emotions.

**Alvaro Castagnet**, Spanish painter

Focusing totally on technique, you lose the essence and power of simplicity … The other extreme is just as bad; you see it in a lot of Modern works, where the concept is more important than the technique, resulting in very poor craftsmanship.

**George Carlson**, American artist

The artist can know all the technique in the world,  
but if he feels nothing, it will mean nothing.

**Chen Chi**, Chinese painter

The human binocular and flickering  
vision, coupled with the precious  
imperfection of the human hand is where  
art lives—there are no shortcuts.

**Dean Taylor Drewyer**, American artist

The fun of painting is technique: loose opposite tight, texture versus wash, light against dark.

**Joe Garcia**, American painter

I want to paint as though my technique were invisible. I want my effort to be in the form and texture created by light, not brushstrokes.

**William Harvey**, English engraver and designer

First one specializes in technique, until he comes to the end of technique and bases everything on the heart itself—this is the best way of practice.

**Trevor Leggett**, English writer and martial artist

## \*\*Techniques

vary; art stays the same: it is  
a transposition of nature at  
once forceful and sensitive.\*\*

**Claude Monet**, French painter

People often think that technical perfection has something to do with fine painting … Rembrandt, whose technique fascinated all great masters after a time, was said to have painted with a tarbrush. So he was not exactly a fine painter.

**Cornelis le Mair**, Dutch painter

Everywhere there is craft and technique;  
everywhere there is artistry and form.  
Art itself, technique, is ponderous and  
clumsy, and because of its awkwardness  
it obstructs that inner element …

**Kazimir Malevich**, Russian painter

The painterly painter avoids the how-  
to approach, suspicious as ever that  
technique will obscure his or her vision.

**Charles Movalli**, American painter

My technique, starting with a quick outline in pencil, is designed to record first impressions, with no time for second thoughts.

**John Newberry**, English painter

Committing oneself to a technique  
causes stagnation.

**Kimon Nicolaïdes**, Greek-American artist

When technique is obtrusive it becomes mere mannerism, a conscious striving for effect. It is only a means to an end—the manner of putting paint to paper. It hardly embraces the expressive side of painting.

**Walter J. Phillips**, Canadian artist

Technique is just a means of  
arriving at a statement.

**Jackson Pollock**, American painter

It takes a long time to become  
loose without losing it.

**Sandy Sandy**, American artist

## \*\*Theories

methods, and formulas aid in  
the making of art, but each  
artist’s technique comes more  
from his or her personality  
than anything else.\*\*

**Randall Sexton**, American painter

If you find yourself with a weakness,  
attack it … don’t develop a technique  
that avoids your weaknesses.

**Nelson Shanks**, American painter

Technical knowledge is not enough.  
One must transcend techniques  
so that art becomes an artless art,  
growing out of the unconscious.

**Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki**, Japanese writer

No matter what techniques I use,  
I still want to go after the eternal,  
meaningful aspects of painting.

**Dan Thompson**, American artist

To be interested solely in technique would  
be a very superficial thing to me.

**Andrew Wyeth**, American artist

Painting around an object will help  
you look at your subjects in a new  
way—as shapes and spaces …

**Mary Todd Beam**, American painter

Lines as edges kill a sense of form.

**Paul Brandford**, English artist

The most important things in a painting  
are Form and Value. Color comes  
last—like a friend you welcome.

**Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot**, French painter

Form is expressed in the light tones by dark  
accents, in the dark tones by light accents.

**Harvey Dunn**, American painter

I see only forms that are lit up and forms that  
are not. There is only light and shadow.

**Francisco de Goya**, Spanish painter

If a form isn’t right, if it’s erased, the  
correction has meaning. It’s the process  
of the mind, moving and making. The  
form didn’t drop from outer space.

**Elliott Green**, American artist

The artist must have something to say, for  
mastery over form is not his goal but rather  
the adapting of form to its inner meaning.

**Wassily Kandinsky**, Russian painter

I’m not interested in edges. I’m interested in the mass and color, the black and white. The edges happen because the forms get as quiet as they can be. I want the masses to perform. When I work with forms and colors, I get the edge …

**Ellsworth Kelly**, American artist

## \*\*My aim is for

ripeness of form. I want to  
make my forms so full, so  
juicy, that one could add  
nothing more to them.\*\*

**Henri Laurens**, French sculptor

If you give a child something very complex to paint, such as a bouquet of flowers or a natural landscape, if he is very good, eventually he will get back—like Cézanne—to the essential forms of what he sees.

**Robert Motherwell**, American painter

The secret of many of my deformations—which many people do not understand—is that there is an interaction, an intereffect between the lines in a painting: one line attracts the other and at the point of maximum attraction the lines curve in toward the attracting point and form is altered.

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

No matter to what degree you carry the detail, it should always be secondary to the pattern. The form is what is important, not the story.

**William F. Reese**, American artist

Draw with the brush. Carve the form. Don’t be carried away by subtleties of modeling and nice pigmentation at the expense of losing the form.

**John Sloan**, American artist

I have to be clear of the form before  
I can really work out my problems  
there in terms of composition.

**Deon Venter**, South African artist

There’s no rule to say you must use only one  
style in a painting. It’s entirely up to you. You’re  
the artist; you’re the boss; it’s your painting.

**Marion Boddy-Evans**, Scottish painter

Style is simply the adoption of an arbitrary  
set of creative rules that one chooses from to  
express oneself. One develops style as selected  
preferences for each creative choice.

**Scott Menaul**, American artist

## CHAPTER 5

###### Medium \*\*

**and**  
\*\*Representation

The mother art is architecture. Without  
an architecture of our own, we have  
no soul of our own civilization.

**Frank Lloyd Wright**, American architect

Architecture is the learned game, correct and  
magnificent, of forms assembled in the light.

**Le Corbusier**, French architect

Architecture starts when you carefully put  
two bricks together. There it begins.

**Ludwig Mies van der Rohe**, German-American architect Architecture is the reaching out for the truth.

**Louis Kahn**, American architect

Our architecture reflects truly as a mirror.

**Louis Sullivan**, American architect

A modern, harmonic, and lively architecture  
is the visible sign of an authentic democracy.

**Walter Gropius**, German architect

A great architect is not made by way of  
a brain nearly so much as he is made by  
way of a cultivated, enriched heart.

**Frank Lloyd Wright**, American architect

Architecture is the work of nations.

**John Ruskin**, English art critic

## \*\*Architecture

aims at eternity.\*\*

**Christopher Wren**, English architect

Architecture has recorded the great  
ideas of the human race. Not only every  
religious symbol, but every human  
thought has its page in that vast book.

**Victor Hugo**, French writer

The job of buildings is to improve  
human relations.

**Ralph Erskine**, Swedish architect

The principle of Gothic architecture  
is infinity made imaginable.

**Samuel Taylor Coleridge**, English writer

Architecture is inhabited sculpture.

**Constantin Brancusi**, Romanian sculptor

Ah, to build, to build\! That is the  
noblest of all the arts.

**Henry Wadsworth Longfellow**, American poet

Architecture begins where engineering ends.

**Walter Gropius**, German architect

Architecture is not all about the design  
of the building and nothing else; it is  
also about the cultural setting and  
the ambience, the whole affair.

**Michael Graves**, American architect

Form ever follows function.

**Louis Sullivan**, American architect

To create architecture is to put in order. Put  
what in order? Function and objects.

**Le Corbusier**, French architect

I don’t think of form as a kind of architecture. The architecture is the result of the forming. It is the kinesthetic and visual sense of position and wholeness that puts the thing into the realm of art.

**Roy Lichtenstein**, American artist

Even though I build buildings and I pursue my architecture, I pursue it as an artist. I deliberately keep a tiny studio. I don’t want to be an architectural firm. I want to remain an artist.

**Maya Lin**, American architect and artist

If a building becomes architecture, then it is art.

**Arne Jacobsen**, Danish architect

A structure becomes architectural, and  
not sculptural, when its elements no longer  
have their justification in nature.

**Guillaume Apollinaire**, French writer

I strive for an architecture from which  
nothing can be taken away.

**Helmut Jahn**, German-American architect

An architect should live as little in cities as a painter. Send him to our hills, and let him study there what nature understands by a buttress, and what by a dome.

**John Ruskin**, English art critic

If I had to say which was telling the truth  
about society, a speech by a Minister of  
Housing or the actual buildings put up in  
his time, I should believe the buildings.

**Kenneth Clark**, English art critic

All architects want to live beyond their deaths.

**Philip Johnson**, American architect

Architecture, of all the arts, is the one that acts  
most slowly but the most surely on the soul.

**Ernest Dimnet**, French writer

Architecture should speak of its time and  
place, but yearn for timelessness.

**Frank Gehry**, Canadian-American architect

## \*\*Painting is the

grandchild of nature.  
It is related to God.\*\*

**Rembrandt van Rijn**, Dutch painter

Painting is silent poetry,  
and poetry is painting that speaks.

**Simonides**, ancient Greek poet

There are painters who transform the sun to a yellow spot, but there are others who, with the help of their art and their intelligence, transform a yellow spot into the sun.

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

Painting: The art of protecting flat surfaces from  
the weather and exposing them to the critic.

**Ambrose Bierce**, American writer

Every time I paint a portrait I lose a friend.

**John Singer Sargent**, American painter

A painting in a museum hears more ridiculous  
opinions than anything else in the world.

**Edmond de Goncourt**, French writer

I experience a period of frightening clarity in those moments when nature is so beautiful. I am no longer sure of myself, and the paintings appear as in a dream.

**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

Painting is just another way of keeping a diary.

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

A good painter is to paint two main things,  
men and the working of man’s mind.

**Leonardo da Vinci**, Italian artist

There are many things one thinks about  
in a painting. Often, it’s how to handle  
your chosen medium and how to best  
reveal the light in a three-dimensional  
form on a two-dimensional surface.

**Janice Tanton**, Canadian artist

Painting is the nail to which I fasten my ideas.

**Georges Braque**, French painter and sculptor

I’ve been doing a lot of abstract painting  
lately, extremely abstract. No brush, no  
paint, no canvas, I just think about it.

**Steven Wright**, American actor

Every good painter paints what he is.

**Jackson Pollock**, American painter

Good painting is the kind that  
looks like sculpture.

**Michelangelo**, Italian artist

## \*\*A sculptor

wields the chisel, and  
the stricken marble grows  
to beauty.\*\*

**William Cullen Bryant**, American poet

Sculpture is more divine, and more like Nature,  
That fashions all her works in high relief,  
And that is Sculpture.  
This vast ball, the Earth,  
Was molded out of clay, and baked in fire;  
Men, women, and all animals that breathe  
Are statues, and not paintings.

**Henry Wadsworth Longfellow**, American poet

Sculpture is the art of the intelligence.

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

I say that the art of sculpture is eight  
times as great as any other art based on  
drawing, because a statue has eight views  
and they must all be equally good.

**Benvenuto Cellini**, Italian artist

A fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make something in stone that hardly resembles a man. The value of statuary is owing to its difficulty. You would not value the finest head cut upon a carrot.

**Samuel Johnson**, English writer

As paradoxical as it may seem, a great sculptor is as much a colorist as the best painter, or rather the best engraver. He plays so skillfully with all the resources of relief, he blends so well the boldness of light with the modesty of shadow, that his sculptures please one as much as the most charming etchings.

**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

Sculpture, a very noble art, is one that does not in the execution require the same supreme ingenuity as the art of painting, since in two most important and difficult particulars, in foreshortening and in light and shade … the painter has to invent a process, \[whereas\] sculpture is helped by nature.

**Leonardo da Vinci**, Italian artist

I did my sculpture as a painter. I did not work as a sculptor.

**Henri Matisse**, French artist

A piece of sculpture can have a hole through  
it and not be weakened if the hole is of a  
studied size, shape, and direction.

**Henry Moore**, English artist

There is no substitute for feeling the stone, the metal, the plaster, or the wood in the hand; to feel its weight; to feel its texture; to struggle with it in the world rather than in the mind alone.

**William M. Dupree**, American sculptor

Bronze is the mirror of the  
form; wine, of the heart.

**Aeschylus**, ancient Greek playwright

A hole in the block of a piece of sculpture  
is in most cases nothing but the expression  
of impotence and weakness.

**Fritz Wotruba**, Austrian sculptor

## \*\*Sculpture

occupies the same space  
as your body.\*\*

**Anish Kapoor**, Indian-English sculptor

The essence of a sculpture must enter on tip-  
toe, as light as animal footprints on snow.

**Jean Arp**, German-French \(Alsatian\) artist

As picture teaches the coloring, so  
sculpture the anatomy of form.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson**, American writer

A great sculpture can roll down  
a hill without breaking.

**Michelangelo**, Italian artist

Sculpture is the art of the  
hole and the lump.

**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

Within every block of wood and stone,  
there dwells a spirit, waiting to be released.  
Direct carving is a way of freeing the spirit—  
my own and that of the stone or wood.

**Hap Hagood**, American sculptor

The stone unhewn and cold  
Becomes a living mold.  
The more the marble wastes,  
The more the statue grows.

**Michelangelo**, Italian artist

There are two devices which can help the sculptor to judge his work: one is not to see it for a while. The other … is to look at his work through spectacles which will change its color and magnify or diminish it, so as to disguise it somehow to his eye, and make it look as though it were the work of another.

**Gianlorenzo Bernini**, Italian artist

Where did I learn to understand sculpture? In the woods by looking at the trees, along roads by observing the formation of clouds, in the studio by studying the model, everywhere except in the schools.

**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

## \*\*The idea is to

write it so that people hear it  
and it slides through the brain  
and goes straight to the heart.\*\*

**Maya Angelou**, American writer

You must keep sending work out; you must never let a manuscript do nothing but eat its head off in a drawer. You send that work out again and again, while you’re working on another one.

**Isaac Asimov**, American writer

Some writers confuse authenticity, which they ought always to aim at, with originality, which they should never bother about.

**W. H. Auden**, Anglo-American poet

Great literature must spring from an upheaval in the author’s soul. If that upheaval is not present, then it must come from the works of any other author which happens to be handy and easily adapted.

**Robert Benchley**, American writer and humorist

No steel can pierce the human heart so chillingly  
as a period put just at the right place.

**Isaac Babel**, Russian writer

Writing about art is only useful when  
it leads to the experience of art.

**Darby Bannard**, American painter

A novel is balanced between a few true  
impressions and the multitude of false ones  
that make up most of what we call life.

**Saul Bellow**, Canadian-born American writer

Always be a poet, even in prose.

**Charles Baudelaire**, French poet

Writing is nothing more than a guided dream.

**Jorge Luis Borges**, Argentine writer

A small drop of ink makes thousands,  
perhaps millions … think.

**Lord Byron**, English poet

Every great and original writer, in proportion  
as he is great and original, must himself create  
the taste by which he is to be relished.

**William Wordsworth**, English poet

Photography can never grow up if it  
imitates some other medium. It has  
to walk alone; it has to be itself.

**Berenice Abbott**, American photographer

## \*\*Literature

is strewn with the wreckage  
of men who have minded  
beyond reason the opinions  
of others.\*\*

**Virginia Woolf**, English writer

There are some books that refuse to be written. They stand their ground year after year and will not be persuaded. It isn’t because the book is not there and worth being written—it is only because the right form of the story does not present itself.

**Mark Twain**, American writer

A photograph is neither taken nor seized by force. It offers itself up. It is the photo that takes you. One must not take photos.

**Henri Cartier-Bresson**, French photographer

Whether working or not, photographers are looking, seeing, and thinking about what they see, a habit that is both a pleasure and a problem, for we seldom capture in a single photograph the full expression of what we see and feel.

**Sam Abell**, American photographer

A photograph is a secret about a secret.  
The more it tells you, the less you know.

**Diane Arbus**, American photographer

Photograph: A picture painted by the  
sun without instruction in art.

**Ambrose Bierce**, American writer

To me, photography is the simultaneous  
recognition, in a fraction of a second,  
of the significance of an event.

**Henri Cartier-Bresson**, French photographer

**Dorothea Lange**, American photographer

A photo must make the viewer feel all the senses with one.

**Todd Plough**, American artist

A photograph is not only an image as a painting is an image, an interpretation of the real; it is also a trace, something directly stenciled off the real, like a footprint or a death mask.

**Susan Sontag**, American writer

For me, the camera is a sketchbook, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity, the master of the instant which, in visual terms, questions and decides simultaneously.

**Henri Cartier-Bresson**, French photographer

There is only you and your camera. The limitations in your photography are in yourself, for what we see is what we are.

**Ernst Haas**, Austrian artist

In the same way the karate practitioner must aim through the block to break it, the artist must aim through the photo to the subject to find the elements that can barely be felt.

**Kitty Wallis**, American artist

## CHAPTER 6

###### The Importance \*\*

\*\*of Art

Art is on the side of the oppressed. Think before you shudder at the simplistic dictum and its heretical definition of the freedom of art. For if art is freedom of the spirit, how can it exist within the oppressors?

**Edith Wharton**, American writer

**Beverly Sills**, American singer

Art is skill; that is the first meaning of the word.

which Nature herself is animated.

**Auguste Rodin**, French sculptor

life in this world except through art.

you use works of art to see your soul.

**Robert Motherwell**, American painter

Wherever art appears, life disappears.

**Robert Motherwell**, American painter

Art is the Queen of all sciences, communicating  
knowledge to all the generations of the world.

**Leonardo da Vinci**, Italian artist

Art should reveal the unknown, to those  
who lack the experience of seeing it.

**Jaune Quick-to-See Smith**, Native American artist The best reason to paint is that there is no reason to paint … I’d like to pretend that I’ve never seen anything, never read anything, never heard anything  
… and then make something … Every time I make something, I think about the people who are going to see it and every time I see something, I think about the person who made it … Nothing is important … so everything is important.

**Keith Haring**, American artist

Art evokes the mystery without which the  
world would not exist.

but what it does to us.

soul that is cheerful by nature, or a soul made  
cheerful by work, love, art, and knowledge.

**Friedrich Nietzsche**, German writer

Art is what delineates the technically correct  
dancer from the dancer who has skill and passion\!

**Curtis Verdun**, American painter

Never lose an opportunity of seeing anything  
beautiful, for beauty is God’s handwriting.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson**, American writer

I want to touch people with my art. I want them  
to say “he feels deeply; he feels tenderly.”

**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

Art is the child of imagination and gives life.

**Mirka Mora**, Australian artist

The true work of art is but a shadow  
of the divine perfection.

**Michelangelo**, Italian artist

The more horrifying this world becomes,  
the more art becomes abstract.

Art enables us to find ourselves and  
lose ourselves at the same time.

As a suffering creature, I cannot do without  
something greater than I—something  
that is my life—the power to create.

**Vincent van Gogh**, Dutch painter

## \*\*Beauty

will save the world.\*\*

**Fyodor Dostoevsky**, Russian writer

We have art in order not to die of life.

**Albert Camus**, French writer

It may be that the deep necessity of art  
is the examination of self-deception.

**Pablo Picasso**, Spanish artist

Art is the closest thing to running  
away, without ever leaving home.

**Twyla Tharp**, American dancer and choreographer If we, citizens, do not support our artists,  
then we sacrifice our imagination on the altar  
of crude reality and we end up believing in  
nothing and having worthless dreams.

**Yann Martel**, Canadian writer

My soul can find no staircase to heaven  
unless it be through Earth’s loveliness.

**Michelangelo**, Italian artist

A person’s life purpose is nothing more than to rediscover, through the detours of art, or love, or passionate work, those one or two images in the presence of which his heart first opened.

**Albert Camus**, French writer

Great art is an instant arrested in eternity.

rather, it makes visible.

**Paul Klee**, German and Swiss painter

There is no must in art because art is free.

To become truly immortal, a work of art must escape all human limits: logic and common sense will only interfere. But once these barriers are broken, it will enter the realms of childhood visions and dreams.

**Giorgio de Chirico**, Greek-born Italian artist What is one to think of those fools who tell  
one that the artist is always subordinate to  
nature? Art is a harmony parallel with nature.

**Paul Cézanne**, French artist

To make us feel small in the right way  
is a function of art; men can only make  
us feel small in the wrong way.

**E. M. Forster**, English writer

Art is the stored honey of the human soul,  
gathered on wings of misery and travail.

**Theodore Dreiser**, American writer

you have one.\*\*

for himself a different order of reality  
from that which is given to him.

I once had the nerve to ask Picasso the  
question, “What is art?” He answered, “Art  
is a lie which makes us see the truth.”

Art is a language that can transcend

consciousness of the artist to the viewer.

Art is a step from what is obvious and well  
known toward what is arcane and concealed.

Only through art can we emerge from ourselves  
and know what another person sees.

Not even the visionary or mystical experience ever lasts very long. It is for art to capture that experience, to offer it to, in the case of literature, its readers; to be, for a secular, materialist culture, some sort of replacement for what the love of god offers in the world of faith.
